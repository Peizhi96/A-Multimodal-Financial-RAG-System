# A-Multimodal-Financial-RAG-System
- Facing a vast amount of data from Starbucks earnings call recordings and financial report PDFs, there was a
critical need for an efficient system to extract key information accurately and rapidly.
- Developed a robust multi-modal system that automatically transcribes Starbucks earnings calls and converts their
financial report PDFs into images, integrating both textual and visual data for seamless financial analysis.
- Leveraged OpenAI Whisper for transcription, pdf2image and Tesseract for PDF conversion, and BERT/CLIP for
embeddings. Processed with PyTorch/TensorFlow and FAISS for vector search.
- Enhanced the speed and accuracy of retrieving Starbucksâ€™ financial and operational insights, providing analysts
with direct and precise data support for more efficient decision-making.
